# Customer Segmentation
## Scope
K-Means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms were deployed on the customer dataset of an example jewelry store. The algorithms were evaluated and compared.

## Summary of Results
Scaling the data produced better results.
The optimal number of clusters found was 5 using the elbow method and Calinski-Harabasz and Silhouette scores.

K-Means clustering algorithm is deemed to be better for clustering the customer dataset due to its quicker execution, scalability, quality results, and ease of use.
